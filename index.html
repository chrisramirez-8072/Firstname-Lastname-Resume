        <p class="lead mb-4">Culture is a huge part of life that many cannot ignore. And a huge part of culture is language. It allows us to communicate with others on a level we would have never imagined. That is why I was interested in studying a Foreign Language when I entered college. I was motivated by my High School Teachers, to use this passion of mine to teach. That is why hopefully after graduation, I could attend graduate school and eventually go back to my old High School and teach there. However, before I would like to travel or study abroad  on my own. <br><br>

        While working part-time as a cashier and volunteering as a tutor and Big Brother, I believe I work great with people. As well as learned a lot from those experiences Iâ€™ve encountered. I personally think that everything we truly learn comes from the experiences we come face to face with. Of course these experiences always have their upsides and downsides. But the truth is these downsides need to occur in order, for many to learn from these mistakes. And yes I know this may sound cliche, but itâ€™s true. Iâ€™ve had to overcome many obstacles in my life, in order to get to where I stand. Around the time, I was in middle school, going to college never seemed possible. I was always convinced I was too poor to pay for school or even get accepted into one. I was never the smartest guy in the room or even felt like there was anything special in me. However, once I entered the AVID program, which happened to be my momâ€™s idea. I began to gain this sense of hope and purpose. That would only develop more and more as time would go by. Including my high school years, where many of my teachers encouraged me to find my purpose.<br><br>

        I decided to major in Spanish, in order to better connect with my own culture. Being Mexican-American, my identity has always been split between two nations. However, I am very proud to be considered both. Although, that is why I would like to travel, before settling down and teaching somewhere. My plan was to always graduate and take some time to travel to either Mexico, some country in South America or even Spain, while teaching English. Once again, speaking about experiences. I feel like everything should take time and visit somewhere they have never been. That way they could reflect on their culture, as well as try to understand someone elseâ€™s. By doing this, you are also given the opportunity to share your own perspectives to the world around you. That is why I want to teach English in these countries, as it becomes a trade off. As it gives me a chance to practice my spanish, as well as teach others englishWhat interests me about these countries that I plan to visit is that despite their differences, they are so similar. Of course they share the same language: Spanish. However, each one has their own identity based on their people, food, and perspective.
